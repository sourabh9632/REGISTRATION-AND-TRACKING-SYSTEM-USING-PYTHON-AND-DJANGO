Your workload will be reduced, and you'll have more time, which will improve staff performance.
          Registration and track system also has some problems by using the software the administration can set up all the courses to their trainers to complete within time course duration is scheduled here registration and tracking software will automatically track their progress.

1.1	PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A learning management system, or LMS, is the most common name for employee training management software. Companies utilise it to offer online learning to their employees, and it guarantees quick implementation, high-quality training delivery, and simplicity of use. Software for employee training enables you to design or upload eLearning courses, assign training materials to specific employees or groups of employees, and monitor learners' progress.  Therefore, have a look at some of the training software solutions described      below if you need to up skill your staff. Your workload will be reduced, and you'll save time, which will improve staff performance. which raise the person's awareness level. Boost a person's proficiency in one or more of their areas of specialisation. Increase an individual’s motivation to perform their job well.
 1.login for the admin – which is having the full authority for example like view the data of the trainer as well as the students ,creating the batch for the particular trainer and students.
2.login for student-Whenever the student login the student is directed to the student login page in which student have authority to have change the password and view the course as well as the topic which have ben covered
3.trainer-sign-whenever the trainer sign in the trainer directly send into trainer header form in which trainer can perform the multiple task such as he can change the password as well as he can give the attendance of the particular student who were  attended to the particular class . So there are many more options are presents like creating session, selecting the topics, creating the batch these are all handled by the main admin
The project contains the different types of the modules in the projects because as earlier we can see that there are many problems facing by the institute because in the particular institute there are n numbers of students get enrolled and different types of trainers are also situated from different fields of study therefore to keep record of the particular they made this software to keep the record of the each and every student and trainer as well as different collages and after the trainer and student allotted to particular course then the batch is created. For the particular students. For this project we have used  the different programming language that is python as we know that python is the high-level programming language which is used to write the programme for the building of the applications like web-development, Machine Learning. so we have used the django frame work because as we know django is the one the most used frame work across the globe because this frame work is very easy to use and understand in the dajngo frame work there is 3 main files which are very much important in the part of python and dajngo development.
 
1.Template file- this file which is very much important for storing the file like html,css,python,javascript and many others. This template file known as skeleton of the particular project.








2.Views file- This is file which is very much important for writing the logic part for the programme because to some of the work in project like view the  table, delete the records, for this all operations we need to write the logic part for this we need the views part to execute the programme.
3.models file- This is the very important file for configuration of the data base and the number of tables present in your projects.

12.A perfect batch is created for the particular course enrolled by the students.







2.3 FEASIBILITY STUDY
	The feasibility study aids in determining  the proposed system will be helpful for the organization or not. It also checks whether the proposes system will meets user requirements or not. There are three parts in feasibility study as follows.

•	Technical Feasibility. 
•	Operational Feasibility. 
•	Economical Feasiblity.

Technical Feasibility 
•	The technical problem of the project will comes in the phase of feasibility study.
•	Whether the required technology is exist to perform proposed task?
•	Whether the system will be upgraded in future?
•	Are there any technical guarantee of correctness, dependability, and information safety?
•	Whether the projected tools have the capability to gather the mandatory data to build the system?

Operational Feasibility
•	Projected systems are helpful only when they are built as software system. The following are some of key problems come to check the viability of the operation.
•	Is there any sustain for the organization from the customer?
•	Once the system is developed and implemented, will system work correctly?
•	The system is to be in agreement with the above declared problems. Earlier, the administration problem and customer necessities have been considered.
•	The fine-structured design would make sure the finest utilization of the computer resources.


Economic Feasibility
	The development price in forming the system is estimated in opposition to the profit derivative from the new system. Economical profit must equivalent or goes over the expenses. The system is economically feasible. It does not need any extra H/W or S/W.

2.4 TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED
Xampp Server:
	The Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, its a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack bundle created by Apache Friends.
Before releasing a website to the primary server, xamp is an another best platform to prvide the servere which is very useful to run the application which we have build for the particular project. Xammp consisting of the localhost which runs on the particular ip address and it also provides n number of coloumns and n number of rows to store the data in the data base.
MySQL:
	It is data base sever that allows user to feed and fetch the structured data as per requirements.
The word "My" is a combination of "SQL," the acronym for structured query language, and "My," the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter.
It enables you to keep track of all of your blog posts, users, plugin data, etc. It is relational because it saves such data in several "tables" and links it with "keys."
 Java scripit
In our project we use the java script for to make the project more interactive and reliable .for the html and css are the considered as the full body but java script is the mechansiam which is undergoing in the website is handeled by the java scrit .
Now a days we can see that java script is the one the most used language all over the world which make complicated work more simplar and understandable.
HTML:
	Marking up in hypertext Language is a fundamental language that is used to create web pages and is easily understood by all browsers.
 The html is also known as the skeleton part of the paroject because without any html we cannot build the application .html is one of the largest used language around the globe.technologies like css (cascading style sheet) and java script are supported by this language. In our project html and css also javascript plays an important role because for the login page and admin pages we use html css for designing the template because to understand the project and make it more interstable for the viewers , HTML offers a way to generate structured texts. Tags, which are written in angle brackets, are used to distinguish HTML elements.
 Input and image tags, for example, add content directly to the page. Other tags, like p>, enclose and describe the text of the document. They may also contain other tags as sub-elements. Browsers employ the HTML tags to decipher the page's content rather than displaying them.
 
CSS:
•	Cascading Style Sheets are used to format the page's content and improve the appearance of web pages.
•	Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS
CSS saves a lot of labour by describing how html elements should be rendered on screens, paper, or in the other media. Multiple web pages' layouts can be managed simultaneously using it. 
External style sheets are kept in CSS files.
 Css is used to make the design for the particular website in our case we use css for the project to become more interactive to the user.



Django:
	A free and open-source web framework built on Python called Django uses the model-view-template design principle. The Django Software Foundation, an independent company registered as a 501 non-profit, looks after it .django is primry used to make the easy to data base system.

• The framework places an emphasis on reusable and "pluggable" components, fewer code, less coupling, quick development, and the don't repeat yourself philosophy.

• Python is utilised everywhere, including in the data models and settings files.

• In addition, Django offers a customizable administrative creation, read, update, and delete interface that is produced dynamically by introspection.

• The Django framework can be thought of as an MVC structure.

• It comprises of an object-relational mapper (ORM) that acts as a middleman between relational databases and data models, which are represented by Python classes ("Model").

• An HTTP request processing system featuring a regular expression-based URL dispatcher and a web templating system ("View") ("Controller").

• PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and Oracle are the four database backends that Django formally supports.

• On Microsoft operating systems, django-mssql can be used with Microsoft SQL Server,

• There are comparable external backends for FireBird, SQL Anywhere, and IBM Db2.

• Django-nonrel is a fork that supports NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Google App Engine's Datastore.
Python:
In our project we have used the main language is python because it is one the most easily understandable language over the world. Python is compiled language which is normaly used for webdesigns,artificial intillegence,machine learning. In our project we have many tables and modules based on the admin so understand easy I have used the python language.

CHAPTER 8

CONCLUSION

Studies have been conducted on electronic learning , blending learning and face to face courses in order to determine which format is most effective . for example ,learning outcome and student satisfaction have been compared between different formats. As learning and teaching are complex processes, this literature review focuses on factors affecting student learning experiences in online learning. Blending learning and professional education. Among the setting ,student presence is important , as well as interaction between students and teachers interactions is important .Researches have found that a number of factors influence students learning expression. According to the literatre experience and review, factors that are especially important for professional education student learning experience and their learning identities are the availability of appropriate teaching.
